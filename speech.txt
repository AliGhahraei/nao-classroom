The way proggramers 

Lets start with the basics. We now learned that programming can do many things, but how do programmers actually solve specific problems?

It is all reduced to inputs and outputs.

An input is the information that is inserted into a program by an user or another program. This information can take many forms: it can be something simple like text that was typed on the keyboard or it can be something more complex, like the image I just read a while ago.

The input is used and manipulated by the computer in order to do different things, like making a calculaton, accelerate a car, or even make a videogame character attack a zombie. These all would be  outputs, which can be defined as the information provided by a computer or program.
